## Problem
How to use share Data with all App Views without using Singleton object.

## How you fix it
SwiftUI gives us the @EnvironmentObject property wrapper for data that should be shared with many views in your app. This lets us share model data anywhere itâ€™s needed, while also ensuring that our views automatically stay updated when that data changes.
## Solution
```
Step 1: Create observable object class

class AppSettings: ObservableObject {
    @Published var userId = 0

Step 2: Creates the AppSettings object, set value and places it into the environment for the navigation view.
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var settings = AppSettings()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                // A button that writes to the environment settings
                Button("Login") {
                    settings.userId = viewModel.user.userId
                }

                NavigationLink(destination: DashboardView()) {
                    Text("Show Dashboard View")
                }
            }
            .frame(height: 200)
        }
        .environmentObject(settings)
    }
}

Step 3: Use AppSettings object within a view that expects to find a userId in the environment.
struct DashboardView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var settings: AppSettings

    var body: some View {
        Text("UserId: \(settings.userId")
    }
}

Tips: If you are using EnvironmentObject in OnAppear method then use asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1.0)
Also if navigationView not worked you can pass settings object in DashboardView().environmentObject(settings)

```
